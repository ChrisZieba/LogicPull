Features

It has since expanded to handle the assembly of PDF, DocX, RTF and XML documents for any project. It is a cloud based automated document assembly service. We give you the tools to quickly create an advanced question and answer interview to be completed by an end user, which in turn creates an answer set to be combined with a template to produce documents.

Installation
------------

A full installation tutorial on a Ubuntu 12.04.3 64 bit server is available [here](http://help.logicpull.com/portal/articles/installation-server). To build LogicPull locally, please see this [article](http://help.logicpull.com/portal/articles/installation-local).

System Requirements 
-------------------

The minimum memory requirement for LogicPull, and all its components is 256 MiB of memory. With only the minimum amount of memory available, the interviews will take longer to process than normal, but will complete successfully. This minimum requirement is dependent on the number of users connected to the server, and the complexity of the tasks being performed.

TODO
----

__Manager__ 

* Add functionality to remove users from the manager
* Add functionality to update a users privileges

__Editor__ 

* Complete Validations. The following validations are not yet implemented.
  * min_date
  * max_date  
    To perform validation for these properties, use 'after logic' and check the date using dateDifference().
* Add descending order into number dropwdown in the editor
* Add drop down list of months as a default in the date field
* Create undo function
* Add a variable lookup/finder in the editor
* Select multiple nodes from graph and move
* Disallow duplicate field names

__Viewer__

* Allow users to change a past variable without having to go back to that question and start from there

Known Issues
------------

* The Settings button in the editor view does not work when the debug preview is running.
* Once a date is entered into the viewer, it cannot be cleared, only changed. 
* When adding question text in the editor, the 'Toggle HTML' button does not reset when the question is closed. To prevent any issues, make sure the default compiled view is visible when exiting the question. 
* Adding format in the editor may interfere with the parsers ability to recognize templates. For example, when bolding text, the editor may insert `<%<bold> someVar %></bold>`. This would prevent the parser to recognize the variable `someVar` since the `<bold>` tag was inserted in between the template tags `<% %>`. To prevent this, you can switch to 'HTML View' and move the bold tag to outside the template tag. This is a rare bug that seems to come up only when re-bolding text.

Possible Improvements
---------------------
* Replace ejs templating engine with more robust solution 
* Replace apache FOP with [XMLMind](http://www.xmlmind.com/foconverter/) 
* Use [Twitter BS 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Use mardown instead of wysihtml5 in the editor
